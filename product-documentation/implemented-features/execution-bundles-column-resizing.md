# Execution Bundles View Column Resizing

## Feature Overview
The Execution Bundles view now supports dynamic column resizing for the first two columns (Execution Bundles and Executions List).

## User Experience
- Users can resize columns by dragging the vertical resizer between columns
- Provides an intuitive way to adjust column widths based on user preference
- Improves readability and information density

## Technical Implementation Details
- Implemented using Vue 3 Composition API
- Reactive state management for column widths
- Dynamic width calculation with constraints

### Resizing Constraints
- Minimum column width: 100 pixels
- Maximum column width: 40% of total container width
- Prevents columns from becoming too narrow or too wide

### Key Technical Components
- `bundlesColumnWidth` and `executionsColumnWidth` reactive refs
- `startResize()` method to initiate column dragging
- `handleResize()` method to calculate and update column widths in real-time
- `stopResize()` method to clean up event listeners
- Uses `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` event listeners for smooth resizing

### Performance Considerations
- Event listeners are added and removed dynamically
- Uses `onUnmounted` hook to ensure cleanup of global event listeners
- Minimal performance overhead with efficient event handling

## Accessibility
- Cursor changes to indicate resizable areas
- Visual feedback when hovering over resizer
- Keyboard navigation not currently implemented (potential future enhancement)

## Potential Future Improvements
- Persist column width preferences in local storage
- Add keyboard shortcuts for column resizing
- Implement more granular width constraints
