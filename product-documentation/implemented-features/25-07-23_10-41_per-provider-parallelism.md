# Per-Provider Parallelism Implementation

## Overview
Implemented per-provider parallelism in the execution worker system, replacing the global concurrency limit with provider-specific limits. This allows different AI providers (Ollama, Claude, OpenAI) to process executions independently and in parallel.

## Key Changes

### 1. Provider-Specific Concurrency Limits
- **Before**: Single global `maxConcurrentExecutions` limit (default: 1)
- **After**: Per-provider concurrency limits stored in `Map<string, number>`
- **Default Limits**:
  - Ollama: 2 concurrent executions
  - Claude: 3 concurrent executions  
  - OpenAI: 3 concurrent executions

### 2. Enhanced Polling Architecture
- **Parallel Processing**: Each provider processes executions independently
- **Provider Isolation**: Issues with one provider don't block others
- **Optimized Queries**: Provider-specific database queries for better performance

### 3. New ExecutionWorker Methods
```typescript
// Set concurrency limit for specific provider
setProviderConcurrencyLimit(provider: string, limit: number): void

// Get concurrency limit for specific provider
getProviderConcurrencyLimit(provider: string): number

// Get all provider limits
getAllProviderConcurrencyLimits(): Record<string, number>
```

### 4. Enhanced ExecutionModel Methods
```typescript
// Get pending executions for specific provider
getPendingExecutionsByProvider(provider: string, limit?: number): Promise<Execution[]>

// Get running executions for specific provider
getRunningExecutionsByProvider(provider: string): Promise<Execution[]>
```

## Implementation Details

### Polling Flow
1. **Fetch Pending Executions**: Get all pending executions from database
2. **Group by Provider**: Organize executions by their provider
3. **Parallel Processing**: Process each provider's executions concurrently using `Promise.all()`
4. **Provider-Specific Limits**: Each provider respects its own concurrency limit

### Provider Processing Flow
1. **Check Running Count**: Query running executions for specific provider
2. **Calculate Available Slots**: `concurrencyLimit - runningCount`
3. **Process Executions**: Start executions up to available slots
4. **Error Isolation**: Provider failures don't affect other providers

### Interrupted Execution Handling
- Groups interrupted executions by provider
- Resumes executions up to each provider's limit
- Maintains provider isolation during recovery

## Benefits

### 1. True Parallelism
- Claude, OpenAI, and Ollama executions run simultaneously
- No cross-provider blocking or interference

### 2. Better Resource Utilization
- Each provider optimized for its capabilities and rate limits
- Local providers (Ollama) can handle more concurrent requests
- API providers respect their rate limits independently

### 3. Improved Throughput
- Overall system throughput significantly increased
- Multiple providers can process work simultaneously
- Better utilization of available resources

### 4. Provider Isolation
- One provider's issues don't affect others
- Independent error handling and recovery
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable

### 5. Scalability
- Easy to add new providers with custom limits
- Dynamic provider management
- Configurable per-provider settings

## Configuration

### Static Configuration (Current Implementation)
Provider limits are set during initialization:
```typescript
private initializeProviderLimits(): void {
    this.providerConcurrencyLimits.set('ollama', 2);
    this.providerConcurrencyLimits.set('claude', 3);
    this.providerConcurrencyLimits.set('openai', 3);
}
```

### Usage Examples
```typescript
// Get current limits
const limits = executionWorker.getAllProviderConcurrencyLimits();
// { ollama: 2, claude: 3, openai: 3 }

// Set custom limit for a provider
executionWorker.setProviderConcurrencyLimit('ollama', 4);

// Get specific provider limit
const claudeLimit = executionWorker.getProviderConcurrencyLimit('claude');
```

## Performance Improvements

### Database Optimization
- Provider-specific queries reduce data transfer
- Targeted filtering improves query performance
- Reduced memory usage with focused result sets

### Concurrency Benefits
- 3x potential throughput increase (all providers working simultaneously)
- Better CPU and network utilization
- Reduced waiting times for executions

### Error Handling
- Isolated failure domains
- Faster recovery from provider-specific issues
- Continued operation when individual providers fail

## Monitoring and Logging

### Enhanced Logging
- Provider-specific execution counts in logs
- Per-provider capacity and utilization reporting
- Detailed provider context in error messages

### Example Log Output
```
Processing 2 pending executions for provider claude (1 currently running, limit: 3)
Processing 1 pending executions for provider ollama (0 currently running, limit: 2)
Resuming interrupted execution: exec-123 (provider: openai)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Configuration**: API endpoints to adjust limits at runtime
2. **Auto-scaling**: Automatic limit adjustment based on provider performance
3. **Health-based Limits**: Reduce limits for unhealthy providers
4. **Priority Queuing**: Provider-specific execution priorities
5. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work based on provider capacity

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time provider utilization metrics
- Per-provider execution statistics
- Provider health and performance indicators

## Technical Notes

### Thread Safety
- All provider operations are async and non-blocking
- Database operations are atomic and consistent
- No shared state between provider processing

### Error Recovery
- Provider-specific error handling
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable
- Automatic retry mechanisms per provider

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintains existing API interfaces
- Graceful handling of unknown providers
- Default fallback limits for new providers

This implementation provides a robust foundation for scalable, parallel execution processing across multiple AI providers while maintaining system reliability and performance.
