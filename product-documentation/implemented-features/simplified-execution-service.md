# Simplified Execution Service

## Overview

The ExecutionService has been significantly simplified by removing the complex in-memory queue system and replacing it with a simple database polling mechanism. This approach is more reliable, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Key Changes

### Before (Complex)
- In-memory processing queue (`Set<string>`)
- Complex initialization with queue management
- Manual queue processing with `queueExecution()` and `processNextInQueue()`
- Background worker calling `processPendingExecutions()`
- Complex concurrency control with in-memory state

### After (Simple)
- Database polling every 2 seconds
- Simple initialization that starts polling
- Direct database queries for work discovery
- Built-in concurrency control via database queries
- Single source of truth (database)

## Architecture

### Polling Mechanism
The service now uses a simple polling approach:

1. **Initialization**: On startup, handle any interrupted running executions
2. **Polling Loop**: Every 2 seconds, check for work:
   - Query database for current running execution count
   - If under concurrency limit, get pending executions to fill available slots
   - Process each execution directly

### Concurrency Control
Concurrency is now controlled purely through database queries:
- Check `count({ status: 'running' })` to get current running executions
- Calculate available slots: `maxConcurrent - runningCount`
- Fetch only the number of pending executions that fit in available slots

### Interrupted Execution Handling
On startup, the service:
1. Finds all executions with `status: 'running'`
2. Processes up to `maxConcurrentExecutions` of them immediately
3. Respects concurrency limits even for interrupted executions

## Benefits

### Simplicity
- Removed ~100 lines of complex queue management code
- Single polling method instead of multiple queue methods
- Easier to understand and debug

### Reliability
- Database is the single source of truth
- No risk of in-memory state getting out of sync
- Handles service restarts gracefully

### Maintainability
- Fewer moving parts
- Less complex state management
- Clearer execution flow

## API Changes

### Removed Methods
- `queueExecution()`
- `processNextInQueue()`
- `waitForRunningExecutionsToComplete()`
- `processPendingExecutions()`
- `getQueueStatus()`

### New/Updated Methods
- `getProcessingStatus()`: Returns current running/pending counts from database
- `shutdown()`: Cleanly stops polling and resets initialization state
- `pollForWork()`: Core polling logic (private)
- `handleInterruptedExecutions()`: Handles running executions on startup (private)

### Unchanged Methods
- `createExecution()`: Still creates pending executions (now picked up by polling)
- `getExecution()`, `getExecutions()`, `getExecutionStats()`: Unchanged
- `cancelExecution()`: Unchanged
- `setMaxConcurrentExecutions()`, `getMaxConcurrentExecutions()`: Unchanged

## Configuration

### Polling Interval
- Default: 2000ms (2 seconds)
- Configurable via `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` constant
- Can be adjusted based on performance requirements

### Concurrency Limit
- Still configurable via `setMaxConcurrentExecutions()`
- Default: 1 concurrent execution
- Respected by both polling and interrupted execution handling

## Implementation Details

### Startup Sequence
1. `initialize()` called
2. `handleInterruptedExecutions()` processes any running executions
3. `startPolling()` begins the polling loop
4. Service marked as initialized

### Polling Loop
1. Check current running execution count in database
2. Calculate available execution slots
3. Fetch pending executions to fill slots
4. Start processing each execution asynchronously
5. Wait for next poll interval

### Shutdown Sequence
1. `shutdown()` called
2. `stopPolling()` clears the interval timer
3. Service marked as not initialized
4. Any running executions continue until completion

## Error Handling

### Polling Errors
- Polling errors are logged but don't stop the polling loop
- Service continues attempting to poll on next interval

### Execution Errors
- Individual execution errors don't affect other executions
- Failed executions are marked as 'failed' in database
- Error details stored in `error_message` field

### Database Errors
- Database connection issues are logged
- Service continues attempting operations
- Graceful degradation where possible

## Performance Considerations

### Database Load
- Polling creates regular database queries every 2 seconds
- Queries are lightweight (count and limit operations)
- Much more efficient than complex in-memory synchronization

### Scalability
- Can easily scale to multiple service instances
- Database handles concurrency control naturally
- No shared in-memory state between instances

### Resource Usage
- Lower memory usage (no in-memory queue)
- Predictable CPU usage (regular polling intervals)
- Database handles the heavy lifting for work distribution
