# File Viewer Dialog Component

**Date:** 2025-07-28 16:05  
**Status:** Implemented  

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive file viewer dialog component that allows users to view PDF and image files directly within the application. The dialog provides a full-screen viewing experience with proper file type detection and error handling.

## Implementation Details

### FileViewDialog Component

Created `ui/src/components/files/FileViewDialog.vue` with the following features:

#### Core Functionality
- **Full-screen dialog**: Uses the same full-screen pattern as ExecutionDetailsDialog
- **File type detection**: Automatically detects PDF and image files based on MIME type
- **Lazy loading**: Fetches file content only when dialog opens
- **Memory management**: Clears file content when dialog closes to prevent memory leaks

#### Supported File Types
- **PDF files**: Rendered using iframe with data URL
- **Image files**: All image MIME types (image/*) displayed with proper scaling
- **Unsupported files**: Shows informative message for non-viewable file types

#### UI Features
- **Loading states**: Spinner while fetching file content
- **Error handling**: Retry button for failed requests
- **File metadata**: Display of file name, MIME type, size, and timestamps
- **Copy functionality**: File ID can be copied to clipboard
- **Responsive design**: Proper scaling for images and PDFs

### FilesTable Integration

Updated `ui/src/components/files/FilesTable.vue` to include:

#### View Button
- Added Eye icon button in the actions column
- Positioned before the delete button
- Hover state with primary color

#### State Management
- `showViewDialog`: Controls dialog visibility
- `selectedFile`: Stores the file to be viewed
- `viewFile()`: Function to open the dialog with selected file

#### User Experience
- Click eye icon to view file
- Full-screen dialog opens immediately
- File content loads asynchronously
- Close dialog to return to table

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
FileViewDialog.vue
├── Template
│   ├── DialogHeader (file name, metadata)
│   ├── Content Area
│   │   ├── Loading state
│   │   ├── Error state
│   │   └── File viewers (PDF/Image/Unsupported)
│   └── Footer (timestamps, file ID)
└── Script
    ├── Props interface
    ├── State management
    ├── File type detection
    ├── Content loading
    └── Utility functions
```

### File Type Detection
- **PDF**: `mimeType === 'application/pdf'`
- **Images**: `mimeType.startsWith('image/')`
- **Data URLs**: Proper base64 encoding with MIME type prefix

### API Integration
- Uses existing `filesApi.getById()` endpoint
- Fetches complete file data including base64 content
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

## User Interface

### Dialog Layout
- **Header**: File name as title, metadata as description
- **Content**: Centered viewer with proper scaling
- **Footer**: Creation/update timestamps and file ID

### File Viewers
- **PDF**: Full-width iframe with border and rounded corners
- **Images**: Responsive scaling with object-contain
- **Unsupported**: Informative message with file type

### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing dialog patterns
- Proper spacing and typography
- Loading and error states match application style
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Immediate preview**: No need to download files to view them
- **Context preservation**: View files without leaving the files page
- **Efficient workflow**: Quick preview before deciding on actions

### Technical Benefits
- **Memory efficient**: Lazy loading and cleanup
- **Type safe**: Proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Extensible**: Easy to add support for more file types
- **Consistent**: Follows established component patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Zoom controls**: For images and PDFs
- **Navigation**: Previous/next file buttons
- **Download button**: Direct download from viewer
- **Text files**: Support for viewing text-based files
- **Video/Audio**: Media player integration

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: Store viewed files temporarily
- **Thumbnails**: Generate and cache thumbnails
- **Streaming**: For large files
- **Progressive loading**: For multi-page PDFs

## Files Modified

1. **ui/src/components/files/FileViewDialog.vue** - New file viewer dialog component
2. **ui/src/components/files/FilesTable.vue** - Added view button and dialog integration

## Dependencies

- Existing UI components (Dialog, Button)
- File API definitions and client
- Utility functions (formatFileSize, formatDate)
- Lucide icons (Eye icon)

The file viewer dialog provides a seamless way for users to preview PDF and image files directly within the application, enhancing the overall file management experience while maintaining performance and usability standards.
