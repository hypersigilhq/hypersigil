# Keyboard Navigation for Execution Bundles

## Feature Overview
Implemented keyboard navigation for the Execution Bundles view, allowing users to navigate through executions using arrow up and down keys.

## Key Behaviors
- Arrow Up/Down keys navigate between execution items in the list
- Navigation wraps around (top to bottom and bottom to top)
- Automatically scrolls to keep the selected item in view
- Adds a visual ring highlight to show the currently focused item

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Added `focusedExecutionIndex` ref to track the currently focused execution
- Initialized to `-1` when a new bundle is selected

### Keyboard Event Handling
- Event listener added when a bundle is selected
- Prevents default scrolling behavior
- Calculates new index based on current focused index
- Supports wrapping navigation (first to last, last to first)

### Scrolling and Visibility
- Uses `nextTick()` to ensure DOM is updated before scrolling
- Scrolls the selected item into view using `scrollIntoView()`
- Uses `block: 'nearest'` to minimize unnecessary scrolling

### Event Listener Management
- Adds/removes keyboard event listener based on bundle selection
- Removes event listeners on component unmount to prevent memory leaks

## Accessibility Considerations
- Provides keyboard-friendly navigation for users who prefer or require keyboard input
- Visual indication of current focus improves usability

## Code Location
- Implemented in `ui/src/views/ExecutionBundlesView.vue`
- Key methods: `handleKeyNavigation()`, `watch(selectedBundle)` event listener
