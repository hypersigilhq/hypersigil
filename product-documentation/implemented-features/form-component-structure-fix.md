# Form Component Structure Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing errors related to form components:

```
useFormField.ts:10 Uncaught (in promise) Error: useFormField should be used within <FormField>
    at useFormField (useFormField.ts:10:11)
    at setup (FormLabel.vue:10:31)
```

This error occurred because the form components (`FormLabel`, `FormControl`, etc.) were being used without the proper component hierarchy required by the `vee-validate` library.

## Root Cause

The form components in the UI are built on top of the `vee-validate` library, which provides form validation functionality. The components follow a specific hierarchy:

1. `Form` - The top-level component that manages the form state
2. `FormField` - Provides context for each form field
3. `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormMessage` - UI components that depend on the context provided by `FormField`

The error occurred because `FormLabel` and other components were being used without being wrapped in a `FormField` component, which provides the necessary context through Vue's dependency injection system.

## Solution

The solution was to update the form structure in the authentication components:

1. Added the `Form` component as the top-level form container
2. Wrapped each form field in a `FormField` component with proper `v-model` binding and `name` attribute
3. Kept the existing `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, and `FormMessage` components within their respective `FormField` wrappers

### Components Updated

1. `RegisterFirstAdminView.vue` - Updated the form structure for the admin registration form
2. `LoginView.vue` - Updated the form structure for the login form

## Benefits

1. **Error Resolution**: Fixed the runtime error that was preventing the forms from rendering properly
2. **Proper Validation**: Enabled proper form validation through the `vee-validate` library
3. **Improved Structure**: Aligned the component structure with the library's intended usage pattern
4. **Better Developer Experience**: Made the form structure more explicit and easier to understand

## Best Practices for Form Components

When using form components in this application:

1. Always start with the `Form` component as the container
2. Wrap each field in a `FormField` component with a unique `name` attribute
3. Use `v-model` on the `FormField` to bind to your data
4. Place `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, and `FormMessage` components inside the `FormField`
5. The `FormMessage` component will automatically display validation errors

Example structure:

```vue
<Form @submit="handleSubmit">
  <FormField v-model="fieldValue" name="fieldName">
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Field Label</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  </FormField>
</Form>
