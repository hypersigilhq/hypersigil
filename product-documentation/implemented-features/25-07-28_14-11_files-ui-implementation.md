# Files UI Implementation

**Date:** 25-07-28_14-11  
**Feature:** Files UI route with table view, debounced search, upload modal, and file management functionality

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive Files management interface in the UI that allows users to view, upload, search, and delete files. The implementation includes a dedicated route, table view with pagination, file upload modal with base64 conversion, and full integration with the existing file API.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Router Configuration

**File:** `ui/src/router/index.ts`
- Added `/files` route pointing to `FilesView.vue`
- Integrated with existing authentication guards

### 2. Navigation Integration

**File:** `ui/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.vue`
- Added Files navigation item with File icon from lucide-vue-next
- Positioned between Test Data and Settings in the navigation menu

### 3. API Client Integration

**File:** `ui/src/services/api-client.ts`
- Added `fileApiClient` using `FileApiDefinition`
- Included in `allApiClients` array for token management
- Implemented `filesApi` helper functions:
  - `selectList()` - Get file select list
  - `list()` - Get paginated files with search and sorting
  - `create()` - Upload new file with event emission
  - `getById()` - Get file by ID
  - `delete()` - Delete file with event emission
  - `searchByName()` - Search files by name pattern

### 4. Event Bus Integration

**File:** `ui/src/services/event-bus.ts`
- Added file-related events to `EventMap`:
  - `'file:created': { fileId: string; name: string }`
  - `'file:deleted': { fileId: string }`

### 5. Views Implementation

**File:** `ui/src/views/FilesView.vue`
- Simple container view with title and description
- Imports and renders `FilesTable` component

### 6. Files Table Component

**File:** `ui/src/components/files/FilesTable.vue`

#### Features Implemented:
- **Table Display:**
  - ID (truncated with ellipsis)
  - Original Name
  - Extension (extracted from filename)
  - MIME Type
  - Size (formatted in human-readable format)
  - Created date (formatted)
  - Actions (delete button)

- **Search & Filtering:**
  - Debounced search input (300ms delay)
  - Sort by: Created Date, Updated Date, Name, Original Name, Size
  - Sort direction: ASC/DESC
  - Real-time search without page refresh

- **Pagination:**
  - 25 items per page
  - Previous/Next navigation
  - Page count display
  - Total results count

- **File Upload Modal:**
  - File selection input
  - Optional display name field
  - Optional description field
  - File size preview
  - Base64 conversion in browser
  - Upload progress indication

- **File Management:**
  - Delete files with confirmation dialog
  - Toast notifications for success/error states
  - Error handling with retry functionality

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Base64 Conversion:** Files are converted to base64 format in the browser using `FileReader` API
- **File Size Formatting:** Utility function converts bytes to human-readable format (KB, MB, GB, etc.)
- **Extension Extraction:** Utility function extracts file extension from filename
- **Debounced Search:** Uses lodash-es debounce for efficient search
- **State Management:** Reactive state for loading, error, pagination, and form data
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript integration with API definitions

## UI/UX Considerations

### Design Consistency
- Follows existing design patterns from PromptsTable.vue
- Uses same UI components (shadcn/ui)
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme
- Maintains table layout and pagination patterns

### User Experience
- Immediate visual feedback for all actions
- Loading states during API calls
- Error states with retry options
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- File size and type information display
- Intuitive upload process with drag-and-drop ready structure

### Accessibility
- Proper form labels and ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible table structure
- Clear action button labels

## Integration Points

### API Integration
- Full integration with file API definitions
- Type-safe API calls using ts-typed-api
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Event emission for file lifecycle events

### State Management
- Vue 3 Composition API with reactive state
- Proper loading and error state management
- Form validation and file type checking
- Pagination state management

### Component Architecture
- Modular component structure
- Reusable utility functions
- Separation of concerns between view and table logic
- Consistent with existing component patterns

## File Upload Process

1. **File Selection:** User selects file through input or future drag-and-drop
2. **Validation:** File type and size validation (extensible)
3. **Base64 Conversion:** File converted to base64 in browser
4. **Metadata Collection:** Display name and description optional fields
5. **API Upload:** File data sent to backend with metadata
6. **Feedback:** Success/error toast notification
7. **Table Refresh:** File list updated automatically

## Future Enhancements

- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Multiple file selection and bulk upload
- File preview functionality
- Advanced filtering by file type/size
- File download functionality
- File sharing and permissions
- Thumbnail generation for images
- File versioning support

## Technical Notes

- Files are stored as base64 in the database through the existing file model
- Upload size limits should be configured at the backend level
- File type validation can be extended based on requirements
- Search functionality searches across file names and metadata
- Pagination is server-side for performance with large file collections

This implementation provides a solid foundation for file management within the Hypersigil application, following established patterns and maintaining consistency with the existing codebase.
