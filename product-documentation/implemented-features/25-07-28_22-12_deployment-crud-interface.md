# Deployment CRUD Interface Implementation

**Date:** 28-07-28 22:12  
**Feature:** Complete deployment management interface with CRUD operations

## Overview

Built a comprehensive CRUD interface for managing prompt deployments, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete deployments with specific AI providers and models. The interface follows existing design patterns and integrates seamlessly with the current UI architecture.

## Implementation Details

### API Client Integration
- **File:** `ui/src/services/api-client.ts`
- Added `deploymentApiClient` with full CRUD operations
- Implemented helper functions for all deployment endpoints:
  - `list()` - Paginated deployment listing with search and sorting
  - `create()` - Create new deployments with validation
  - `getById()` / `getByName()` - Retrieve specific deployments
  - `update()` - Update existing deployments (name immutable)
  - `delete()` - Remove deployments with confirmation
  - `run()` - Execute deployments with user input
- Added deployment events to event bus for real-time updates

### Event Bus Integration
- **File:** `ui/src/services/event-bus.ts`
- Added deployment-specific events:
  - `deployment:created` - Triggered on successful creation
  - `deployment:updated` - Triggered on successful updates
  - `deployment:deleted` - Triggered on successful deletion

### Routing and Navigation
- **File:** `ui/src/router/index.ts`
- Added `/deployments` route pointing to `DeploymentsView.vue`
- **File:** `ui/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.vue`
- Added "Deployments" menu item with Rocket icon
- Positioned between "Files" and "Settings" in navigation

### Main View Component
- **File:** `ui/src/views/DeploymentsView.vue`
- Simple view wrapper following existing patterns
- Includes page title and description
- Renders `DeploymentsTable` component

### Deployments Table Component
- **File:** `ui/src/components/deployments/DeploymentsTable.vue`
- **Features:**
  - Search functionality with debounced input
  - Sortable columns (name, provider, model, created_at, updated_at)
  - Pagination with page navigation
  - Loading and error states
  - Responsive table layout
- **Table Columns:**
  - Name (deployment identifier)
  - Prompt (linked prompt name with tooltip)
  - Provider (badged display)
  - Model (provider-specific model)
  - Options (temperature, topP, topK display)
  - Created/Updated timestamps
  - Actions dropdown
- **Actions:**
  - Run deployment (placeholder for future implementation)
  - Edit deployment (opens dialog)
  - Delete deployment (with confirmation)

### Create/Edit Dialog Component
- **File:** `ui/src/components/deployments/CreateEditDeploymentDialog.vue`
- **Layout:** Two-column grid design
- **Left Column:**
  - Name field (disabled for editing as required)
  - Prompt selection dropdown (populated from API)
  - Provider selection (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
  - Model selection (dynamically loaded based on provider)
- **Right Column:**
  - Deployment options section
  - Temperature control (0.0 - 2.0)
  - Top P control (0.0 - 1.0)
  - Top K control (integer â‰¥ 1)
- **Features:**
  - Form validation with proper error handling
  - Dynamic model loading with loading states
  - Name immutability enforcement for edits
  - Toast notifications for success/error states
  - Proper TypeScript integration

## Technical Architecture

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript integration with deployment API definitions
- Proper type imports from `ui/src/services/definitions/deployment.ts`
- Type-safe form handling and validation
- Provider name validation using `AIProviderNamesDefinition`

### UI/UX Consistency
- Follows existing design patterns from `PromptsTable.vue`
- Uses shadcn/ui components throughout
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### State Management
- Vue 3 Composition API with reactive state
- Proper loading/error state management
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Dynamic model loading based on provider selection

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing toast system
- Uses global confirmation dialog service
- Follows established API client patterns
- Consistent with existing table and dialog components

## Key Features

1. **Name Immutability**: Deployment names cannot be changed after creation, as specified in requirements
2. **Dynamic Model Loading**: Models are fetched based on selected provider
3. **Optional Configuration**: Deployment options (temperature, topP, topK) are optional
4. **Search and Filtering**: Full-text search across deployment properties
5. **Sorting and Pagination**: Standard table controls for large datasets
6. **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

## Future Enhancements

- Run deployment functionality (currently shows placeholder toast)
- Deployment execution history and logs
- Batch operations for multiple deployments
- Export/import deployment configurations
- Deployment templates and presets

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `ui/src/views/DeploymentsView.vue`
- `ui/src/components/deployments/DeploymentsTable.vue`
- `ui/src/components/deployments/CreateEditDeploymentDialog.vue`

### Modified Files
- `ui/src/services/api-client.ts` - Added deployment API client
- `ui/src/services/event-bus.ts` - Added deployment events
- `ui/src/router/index.ts` - Added deployments route
- `ui/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.vue` - Added menu item

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready deployment management interface that integrates seamlessly with the existing Hypersigil application architecture.
