# File Upload Support for AI Providers

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive file upload functionality across all AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama) to support multimodal interactions, including image analysis, PDF document processing, and other file types.

## Implementation Details

### Base Provider Interface
- Added `FileAttachment` interface to define file structure:
  - `name`: Original filename
  - `mimeType`: MIME type of the file
  - `data`: Base64 encoded file content
  - `size`: File size in bytes
- Extended `ExecutionOptions` interface with optional `files` array
- Added `supportsFileUpload()` method to provider interface for capability detection

### Provider-Specific Implementation

#### Anthropic Provider  
- **Claude Vision**: Implements Anthropic's vision capabilities
- **Message Format**: Uses structured content blocks with `image` type and base64 source
- **Media Type Support**: Preserves original MIME type for proper format handling
- **PDF Support**: PDFs are included as base64 text descriptions in the message content
- **Content Structure**: Combines text, image, and file content in single message array

### Technical Architecture

#### File Processing Flow
1. Files received as `FileAttachment` objects with base64 encoded data
2. Provider-specific formatting applied based on API requirements
3. Image files processed for vision capabilities, PDFs and other files included as text descriptions
4. Integrated into existing message/prompt structure
5. Sent to respective AI provider APIs

#### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of unsupported file types
- Provider-specific error messages for file upload failures
- Fallback to text-only mode if file processing fails
- Proper error propagation through existing error handling system

#### Performance Considerations
- Base64 encoding handled at client level before reaching providers
- No additional file processing overhead in provider layer
- Efficient memory usage through streaming where possible
- Proper cleanup of temporary data structures

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Image Analysis
```typescript
const options: ExecutionOptions = {
  files: [{
    name: 'screenshot.png',
    mimeType: 'image/png',
    data: 'iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...', // base64 data
    size: 1024000
  }],
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 1000
};

const result = await provider.execute(
  "Analyze this image and describe what you see",
  "Please provide a detailed description",
  "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  options
);
```

#### PDF Document Processing
```typescript
const options: ExecutionOptions = {
  files: [{
    name: 'document.pdf',
    mimeType: 'application/pdf',
    data: 'JVBERi0xLjQKJcOkw7zDtsO8...', // base64 PDF data
    size: 2048000
  }],
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 2000
};

const result = await provider.execute(
  "Analyze this PDF document and summarize its contents",
  "Please provide a detailed summary of the document",
  "gpt-4",
  options
);
```

#### Mixed File Types Processing
```typescript
const options: ExecutionOptions = {
  files: [
    {
      name: 'chart.png',
      mimeType: 'image/png',
      data: 'iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...',
      size: 500000
    },
    {
      name: 'report.pdf',
      mimeType: 'application/pdf',
      data: 'JVBERi0xLjQKJcOkw7zDtsO8...',
      size: 1500000
    }
  ]
};
```

### Capability Detection
All providers now expose file upload capabilities:
```typescript
if (provider.supportsFileUpload?.()) {
  // Provider supports file uploads
  // Show file upload UI components
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Execution Service**: Passes file attachments through to providers
- **API Definitions**: Extended to include file upload parameters
- **Frontend Integration**: Ready for file upload UI components
- **Test Data System**: Can include file attachments in test scenarios

### Future Enhancements
- Support for additional document formats (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- File size validation and optimization
- Batch file processing capabilities
- File caching and deduplication
- Advanced image preprocessing options
- OCR integration for scanned documents
- Document parsing and text extraction improvements

## Benefits
- **Multimodal AI**: Enables vision and image analysis capabilities
- **Provider Agnostic**: Consistent interface across all AI providers
- **Extensible**: Easy to add support for new file types
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient handling of binary data
- **Error Resilient**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multimodal AI interactions while maintaining the existing architecture's simplicity and reliability.
