# Multiple File Upload Dialog Component

**Date:** 2025-07-28 14:20  
**Feature:** Multiple File Upload with Status Tracking

## Overview

Extracted the upload dialog from FilesTable.vue into a separate reusable component and enhanced it with multiple file upload capabilities and individual file status tracking.

## Implementation Details

### New Component: FileUploadDialog.vue

Created `ui/src/components/files/FileUploadDialog.vue` with the following features:

#### Multiple File Selection
- Support for selecting multiple files at once using `multiple` attribute
- Drag and drop interface (visual indication)
- File queue management with add/remove capabilities

#### Individual File Status Tracking
- **Pending**: Files waiting to be uploaded (gray circle)
- **Uploading**: Files currently being processed (spinning loader)
- **Completed**: Successfully uploaded files (green checkmark)
- **Error**: Failed uploads with error messages (red X)

#### Enhanced User Experience
- Visual progress indicators for each file
- Overall progress summary with completion statistics
- Editable display name and description for each pending file
- Individual file removal from queue
- Clear all functionality
- Sequential upload processing to avoid server overload

#### Status Management
```typescript
type FileUploadStatus = 'pending' | 'uploading' | 'completed' | 'error'

interface FileUploadItem {
    file: File
    displayName: string
    description: string
    status: FileUploadStatus
    error?: string
}
```

### Updated FilesTable.vue

#### Refactored Integration
- Removed inline upload dialog code
- Imported and integrated FileUploadDialog component
- Simplified upload button to trigger external dialog
- Cleaned up unused imports and functions

#### Maintained Functionality

- File list refreshes automatically after successful uploads
- Consistent UI/UX with existing table design

### Key Features

#### Multi-File Queue Management

- Clear entire queue functionality

#### Progress Tracking
- Individual file status indicators
- Overall progress bar and statistics

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
FileUploadDialog.vue
├── File Selection Area (drag & drop interface)
├── File Queue List (scrollable with individual status)
├── Progress Summary (overall statistics)
└── Action Buttons (cancel/upload)
```

### State Management
- Reactive file queue with status tracking
- Computed properties for queue statistics
- Proper cleanup on dialog close
- Sequential upload processing

### Error Handling
- Individual file error tracking
- Graceful failure handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Partial success scenarios

## Benefits

### User Experience
- Upload multiple files simultaneously
- Clear visual feedback for each file
- Ability to edit metadata before upload
- Better error visibility and handling

### Code Organization
- Separated concerns with dedicated component
- Reusable upload dialog for other parts of the application
- Cleaner FilesTable.vue with focused responsibilities
- Maintainable and testable code structure

### Performance
- Sequential upload processing prevents server overload
- Efficient file handling with proper cleanup
- Optimized re-rendering with computed properties

## Usage

```vue
<FileUploadDialog 
    v-model:open="showUploadDialog" 
    @uploaded="handleUploadComplete" 
/>
```

The component emits an `uploaded` event when files are successfully uploaded, allowing parent components to refresh their data accordingly.
