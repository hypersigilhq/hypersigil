# OpenAI Provider JSON Schema Required Fields Fix

## Summary
Fixed OpenAI Responses API structured output error by implementing schema sanitization to ensure all properties are included in the `required` array.

## Problem
The OpenAI Responses API with `json_schema` format requires that all properties defined in a JSON schema must be listed in the `required` array. The error message was:
```
400 Bad Request - Invalid schema for response_format 'schema-name': In context=(), 'required' is required to be supplied and to be an array including every key in properties. Missing 'tender_currency'.
```

## Solution
Implemented `sanitizeSchemaForOpenAI` method in the OpenAI provider that:

1. **Automatically populates required array**: For any schema with `properties`, ensures all property keys are included in the `required` array
2. **Handles nested schemas**: Recursively processes nested object schemas (properties of type object)
3. **Merges existing requirements**: If a schema already has a `required` field, merges it with the auto-generated requirements
4. **Preserves schema integrity**: Copies over all supported JSON Schema fields (type, description, enum, validation constraints, etc.)

## Technical Details
- Added `sanitizeSchemaForOpenAI(schema: JSONSchema): any` private method to `OpenAIProvider` class
- Modified the `execute` method to use `this.sanitizeSchemaForOpenAI(options.schema)` when setting the structured output format
- The method recursively processes schemas to handle complex nested structures
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing schemas that may already have proper `required` arrays

## Impact
- Fixes structured output functionality for OpenAI provider
- Ensures compliance with OpenAI's API requirements
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Improves reliability of JSON schema-based prompt executions

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/providers/openai-provider.ts`: Added schema sanitization method and updated execute method

## Testing
- Verified TypeScript compilation passes
- Schema sanitization handles various JSON Schema structures correctly
- Maintains all existing schema validation and type safety features
