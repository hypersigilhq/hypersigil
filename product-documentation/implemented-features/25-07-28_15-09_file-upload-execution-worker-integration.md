# File Upload Integration in Execution Worker

**Date:** 25-07-28_15-09  
**Feature:** File Upload Support in Execution Worker

## Overview

Enhanced the execution worker to support file uploads by fetching file data when a `fileId` is present in an execution and the provider supports file uploads. This enables AI providers to process uploaded files as part of prompt executions.

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes

1. **Import Additions**
   - Added `fileModel` import to access file data
   - Added `FileAttachment` import from base provider types

2. **File Processing Logic**
   - Added file fetching and validation logic in `processExecution` method
   - Checks if execution has a `fileId` and if the provider supports file uploads
   - Fetches file data from the database using the file model
   - Converts file data to `FileAttachment` format for provider consumption

### File Upload Flow

1. **Validation Phase**
   - Check if `fileId` is present in execution
   - Verify that the selected provider supports file uploads via `provider.supportsFileUpload()`
   - If fileId exists but provider doesn't support uploads, execution fails with appropriate error

2. **File Fetching Phase**
   - Fetch file data from database using `fileModel.findById(execution.fileId)`
   - Handle file not found scenarios with proper error messaging
   - Convert file data to `FileAttachment` interface format

3. **Provider Integration**
   - Add file attachment to execution options as `options.files = [fileAttachment]`
   - Provider receives file data in standardized format with name, mimeType, base64 data, and size

### Error Handling

- **File Not Found**: Execution fails with message "File not found: {fileId}"
- **Provider Doesn't Support Files**: Execution fails with message "Provider {provider} does not support file uploads"
- **File Fetch Error**: Execution fails with detailed error message about fetch failure

### Provider Support Status

- **Anthropic Provider**: ✅ Supports file uploads (`supportsFileUpload(): true`)
- **OpenAI Provider**: ❌ Currently disabled (`supportsFileUpload(): false`)
- **Ollama Provider**: ❌ Currently disabled (`supportsFileUpload(): false`)

### Code Structure

```typescript
// Handle file upload if fileId is present and provider supports it
if (execution.fileId && provider.supportsFileUpload()) {
    try {
        const file = await fileModel.findById(execution.fileId);
        if (!file) {
            // Handle file not found
            return;
        }

        const fileAttachment: FileAttachment = {
            name: file.name,
            mimeType: file.mimeType,
            dataBase64: file.data,
            size: file.size
        };

        options.files = [fileAttachment];
        console.log(`Added file ${file.name} (${file.mimeType}) to execution ${executionId}`);
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle fetch errors
        return;
    }
} else if (execution.fileId && !provider.supportsFileUpload()) {
    // Handle unsupported provider
    return;
}
```

## Technical Benefits

1. **Provider Agnostic**: File handling works with any provider that implements `supportsFileUpload()`
2. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly typed `FileAttachment` interface
4. **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
5. **Single File Support**: Currently supports one file per execution (can be extended)

## Usage Scenarios

- **Document Analysis**: Upload PDFs, text files for content analysis
- **Image Processing**: Upload images for vision model processing
- **Data Processing**: Upload CSV, JSON files for data analysis
- **Code Review**: Upload source code files for analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple File Support**: Extend to support multiple files per execution
2. **File Type Validation**: Add validation based on provider capabilities
3. **File Size Limits**: Implement size restrictions per provider
4. **Caching**: Add file caching to avoid repeated database queries
5. **OpenAI/Ollama Support**: Enable file upload support for additional providers

## Integration Points

- **File Model**: Uses existing file storage and retrieval system
- **Provider Registry**: Leverages provider capability detection
- **Execution Model**: Works with existing fileId field validation
- **Error Handling**: Integrates with existing execution status management

This implementation provides a robust foundation for file upload processing in AI executions while maintaining compatibility with existing execution workflows.
