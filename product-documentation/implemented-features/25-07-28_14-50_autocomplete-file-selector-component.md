# Autocomplete File Selector Component with Pill Design

**Date:** 25-07-28_14-50  
**Feature:** Enhanced FileSelector.vue with autocomplete functionality and pill-based selection

## Overview

Updated the FileSelector.vue component to work as an autocomplete with pill-based selection display. When no file is selected, users see a search input. Once a file is selected, it displays as a pill with file metadata and a clear button, providing a modern and intuitive user experience.

## Key Features

### Dual State Design
- **Empty State**: Shows search input field for file selection
- **Selected State**: Displays selected file as a pill with clear button
- Clean transition between states based on selection status

### Pill-Based Selection Display
- Selected file appears as a styled pill/badge with blue background
- Shows file name with truncation for long names
- Includes clear button (X) to remove selection
- Displays file metadata (size, file type) alongside the pill
- Non-editable once selected - prevents accidental text changes

### Autocomplete Functionality
- Dropdown appears on focus and shows all files when search is empty
- Real-time filtering based on search query (name, originalName, mimeType)
- Dropdown hides on blur with proper delay for click handling
- Custom styling with hover states and highlighting

### Clear Selection Feature
- Clear button (X) in the pill removes the selection
- Emits empty fileId to parent component on clear
- Returns component to initial search state
- Proper event emission for parent component reactivity

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Arrow Down/Up**: Navigate through dropdown options
- **Enter**: Select highlighted option
- **Escape**: Close dropdown
- Proper index management for nullOption support

### Enhanced UX Features
- Shows file metadata (size, file type) in dropdown and pill
- Debounced search with 300ms delay
- Proper focus/blur handling to prevent dropdown flickering
- Mouse hover highlighting with keyboard navigation sync

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```vue
<template>
  <div class="relative">
    <Label>{{ label }}</Label>
    <!-- Show pill when file is selected -->
    <div v-if="selectedFile" class="pill-container">
      <div class="pill">
        <span>{{ selectedFile.name }}</span>
        <button @click="clearSelection">Ã—</button>
      </div>
      <div class="metadata">{{ formatFileSize(selectedFile.size) }}</div>
    </div>
    <!-- Show input when no file is selected -->
    <div v-else>
      <Input v-model="searchQuery" @focus="showDropdown = true" />
      <div v-if="showDropdown" class="dropdown">
        <!-- File options with metadata -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

### State Management
- `searchQuery`: Input field value for filtering (empty when file selected)
- `showDropdown`: Controls dropdown visibility
- `highlightedIndex`: Tracks keyboard navigation position
- `selectedFile`: Computed property for currently selected file
- `selectedFileId`: Internal state for selected file ID

### Event Handling
- `debouncedSearch()`: Debounced filtering with timeout management
- `selectFile()`: Handles file selection and clears search query
- `clearSelection()`: Removes selection and emits events to parent
- `handleBlur()`: Manages dropdown hiding with click delay
- `handleKeydown()`: Keyboard navigation implementation

### Key Methods
- `clearSelection()`: Clears selected file and emits empty values to parent component
- `selectFile()`: Sets selected file and transitions to pill display
- `filteredFiles`: Computed property that shows all files when search is empty

## File Changes

### Updated Files
- `ui/src/components/files/FileSelector.vue`: Complete rewrite with autocomplete functionality

### Key Improvements
1. **Better UX**: Single field interaction instead of two separate controls
2. **Real-time Filtering**: Immediate feedback as user types
3. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support
4. **Visual Feedback**: Hover states and selection highlighting
5. **Responsive Design**: Proper dropdown positioning and overflow handling

## Usage

The component maintains the same API as before:

```vue
<FileSelector 
  v-model="selectedFileId"
  label="Select File"
  :nullOption="true"
  @fileSelected="handleFileSelection"
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: More intuitive single-field interaction
2. **Better Performance**: Efficient client-side filtering
3. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support
4. **Modern Interface**: Follows contemporary autocomplete patterns
5. **Maintained Compatibility**: Same props and events as original component

The autocomplete file selector provides a more modern and user-friendly interface while maintaining all existing functionality and API compatibility.
