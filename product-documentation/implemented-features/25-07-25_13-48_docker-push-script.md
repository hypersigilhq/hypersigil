# Docker Multi-Architecture Build and Push Script

## Overview
A comprehensive shell script that automates the process of building and pushing multi-architecture Hypersigil Docker images to Docker Hub registry using Docker Buildx. The script provides an interactive interface for tag selection, platform selection, and includes proper validation and error handling.

## Implementation Details

### Script Location
- **File**: `push-docker.sh`
- **Permissions**: Executable (`chmod +x`)

### Key Features

#### 1. Multi-Architecture Support
- **Docker Buildx Integration**: Uses Docker Buildx for cross-platform builds
- **Platform Selection**: Interactive platform selection with predefined options
- **Default Platforms**: `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` (Intel/AMD and ARM64)
- **Custom Platform Support**: Allows custom platform combinations
- **Automatic Builder Management**: Creates and manages dedicated buildx builder

#### 2. Interactive Tag Selection
- Prompts user for custom tag name
- Provides tag suggestions:
  - `latest` (most recent stable version)
  - Semantic versioning (`v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`, etc.)
  - Environment-specific (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`)
  - Date-based (current date format)

#### 3. Platform Options
- **Multi-architecture (Recommended)**: `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
- **AMD64 only**: `linux/amd64` (Intel/AMD processors)
- **ARM64 only**: `linux/arm64` (Apple Silicon, ARM servers)
- **Custom platforms**: User-defined platform combinations

#### 4. Validation and Safety Checks
- **Docker Buildx Availability**: Verifies Buildx is installed and available
- **Docker Hub Authentication**: Checks if user is logged into Docker Hub
- **Source Directory Verification**: Confirms required `ui` and `backend` directories exist
- **Tag Name Validation**: Ensures tag follows Docker naming conventions
- **Build Confirmation**: Requires user confirmation before building and pushing

#### 5. Docker Hub Integration
- **Repository**: `codefibers/hypersigil`
- **Direct Build and Push**: Builds and pushes in a single operation
- **Multi-platform Manifest**: Creates unified manifest supporting all target platforms

#### 6. User Experience Features
- **Colored Output**: Uses consistent color scheme matching `build-docker.sh`
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear status messages throughout the build process
- **Platform Information**: Shows supported platforms in success message
- **Usage Instructions**: Provides pull and run commands after successful push
- **Builder Cleanup**: Optional removal of buildx builder after completion

### Script Workflow

1. **Pre-flight Checks**
   - Verify Docker Buildx availability
   - Check Docker Hub authentication status
   - Offer to login if not authenticated
   - Confirm required source directories exist

2. **Tag Selection**
   - Display tag suggestions with explanations
   - Validate user input against Docker naming rules
   - Confirm final tag selection

3. **Platform Selection**
   - Present platform options (multi-arch, AMD64, ARM64, custom)
   - Validate platform selection
   - Configure target platforms for build

4. **Builder Setup**
   - Create or reuse dedicated buildx builder (`hypersigil-builder`)
   - Configure builder for multi-platform builds
   - Bootstrap builder if newly created

5. **Multi-Architecture Build and Push**
   - Execute `docker buildx build` with selected platforms
   - Build images for all target architectures simultaneously
   - Push multi-platform manifest to Docker Hub
   - Provide detailed progress feedback

6. **Post-build Cleanup**
   - Optional removal of buildx builder
   - Final status confirmation with platform information

### Error Handling
- **Missing Buildx**: Directs user to install Docker Desktop or enable Buildx
- **Missing Source Directories**: Validates `ui` and `backend` directories exist
- **Authentication Issues**: Guides through Docker login process
- **Invalid Tag Names**: Provides clear validation feedback
- **Build Failures**: Proper error reporting and exit codes
- **Platform Validation**: Ensures valid platform specifications

### Integration with Build System
- **Direct Source Build**: Builds directly from source (no dependency on local image)
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches color scheme and output format of build script
- **Repository Configuration**: Hard-coded Docker Hub repository (`codefibers/hypersigil`)
- **Buildx Builder Management**: Handles builder lifecycle automatically

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
./push-docker.sh
```

### Example Session
```
ðŸš€ Starting Hypersigil Docker multi-architecture build and push process...

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **Docker CLI**: With Buildx extension and push permissions
- **Docker Buildx**: Multi-platform build support (included in Docker Desktop)
- **Source Code**: `ui` and `backend` directories with complete source
- **Docker Hub Account**: With access to `codefibers/hypersigil` repository

### Configuration
- **Docker Repository**: `codefibers/hypersigil`
- **Builder Name**: `hypersigil-builder` (automatically managed)
- **Default Platforms**: `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
- **Shell**: Bash with `set -e` for error handling
