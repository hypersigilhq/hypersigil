### Use Cases and Examples

#### Image Analysis Testing

Upload a collection of product images and test how your prompts analyze visual content, identify features, or generate descriptions. This is particularly valuable for e-commerce, content moderation, or visual search applications.

#### Document Processing Workflows

Upload PDF documents such as contracts, reports, or manuals to test how your prompts extract information, summarize content, or answer questions about document contents.

#### Mixed Media Scenarios

Combine text-based test data with relevant images or documents to create comprehensive testing scenarios that mirror real-world usage patterns.
