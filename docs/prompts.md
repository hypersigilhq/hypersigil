## Prompts

At the heart of Hypersigil lies the concept of prompts - these are the instructions or conversation starters you provide to AI systems. A prompt might be as simple as "Summarize this text" or as complex as a detailed persona with specific formatting requirements and behavioral guidelines. The platform treats prompts as living documents that can evolve over time through testing and refinement.

### Prompt Versioning and Evolution

Prompts in the system are versioned, meaning you can track how your instructions change over time and compare the performance of different versions. This versioning system becomes particularly valuable when you're iterating on prompt design, as you can always return to previous versions if new changes don't improve performance.

The platform supports dynamic prompts through template variables, allowing you to create flexible instructions that can be customized for different inputs. This templating system uses Mustache syntax, enabling you to create prompts that adapt to different contexts while maintaining consistent structure and tone.

### Prompt Testing and Calibration

The commenting system allows you to annotate specific parts of AI responses, creating a feedback loop that can inform prompt improvements. These comments become particularly powerful when combined with the calibration feature, which can analyze your feedback and suggest specific improvements to your prompts.

When you have gathered feedback through comments on execution results, the calibration system can process this information and generate suggestions for how to modify your prompts to address the issues you've identified. This creates a data-driven approach to prompt improvement that goes beyond trial and error.
